# Axiomatize

This website was made as a final project for a university course in Modern Geometry.
The core idea was to create a puzzle game that enables the player to gain insight into
certain math concepts such as an axiomatic system. In the game the player is given
a number of objectives and certain tools to fulfill those objectives. Some of the
levels actually yield simple finite geomotries commonly used in a college level
geomtry class.

Currently the project was left to slowly become dilapidated the moment finals week was
past and the project presented in front of the class. However, I eventually plan to fix 
the current bugs and add more content as soon as I figure out how to time travel (or
master time management - whichever comes first).
